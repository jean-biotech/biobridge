# Why BioBridge Exists

I created BioBridge because I was once exactly where you might be now: curious about biotechnology, but unsure where to start.

---

## The Problem I Saw

When I first became interested in biotech, I felt overwhelmed. Every resource assumed I already knew the basics. Career paths seemed credential-gated and intimidating. I didn't know anyone in the field to ask for guidance.

The information was out there, but it wasn't **accessible**. Not in the sense of being freely available, but in the sense of being approachable, welcoming, and designed for beginners.

---

## The Inspiration

I learned about First Generation Investors, an organization that teaches students about investing by giving them real money to invest. They lower the barrier to entry through education, hands-on experience, and removing the intimidation factor.

I thought: **What if we did this for biotech?**

## What BioBridge Does Differently

BioBridge doesn't require you to have a science background. We don't assume you know what PCR or CRISPR means. We meet you where you are and help you take your first step.

Instead of comprehensive courses or expensive programs, we provide:
- **Plain-language explanations** of what biotech actually is
- **Multiple career pathways** (not just "become a researcher")
- **Curated, free resources** for self-directed learning
- **Human connection** through mentorship (coming soon)

## The Goal

BioBridge isn't about turning everyone into scientists. It's about making biotech **feel possible** for people who never thought it was for them.

If you're curious, that's enough.

## Who I Am

*(Customize this section with your actual background and story)*

I'm a student interested in making biotechnology more accessible to people from all backgrounds. BioBridge started as a personal project to help others navigate the field I found so confusing when I started.
