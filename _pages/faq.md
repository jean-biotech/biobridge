  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <p>Common questions from people just starting to explore biotechnology.</p>
</div>

<div class="bb-faq-content" markdown="1">

## "I am in high school. Where do I start?"

Start with [What is Biotech?](/what-is-biotech/) to understand what the field actually is. Then browse the [Career Pathways](/career-pathways/) to see what roles exist.

**Action steps:**
- Read biotech news (check our [Resource Hub](/resources/))
- Take AP Biology or chemistry if available
- Look for summer programs or science competitions
- Follow biotech companies on social media to see what they do

You have plenty of time to explore.

---

## "I am in college but not majoring in biology. Can I still get into biotech?"

**Absolutely.** Biotech needs:
- Engineers (process, chemical, mechanical)
- Computer scientists (bioinformatics, data analysis)
- Business majors (operations, sales, strategy)
- Communications majors (science writing, marketing)

Check out [Career Pathways](/career-pathways/) to see non-research roles.

---

## "I am changing careers. Is it too late?"

Not at all. Many people enter biotech in their 30s, 40s, or later.

**Common paths for career changers:**
- Project management (if you have PM experience)
- Regulatory affairs (especially with a legal/compliance background)
- Sales and business development
- Manufacturing and operations
- Science communication

Some roles value your previous experience more than a biotech background.

---

## "I do not have a science background. Can I still learn?"

Yes. Our entire site is designed for beginners.

**Begin with these steps:**
1. Read [What is Biotech?](/what-is-biotech/) -- no prerequisites needed
2. Explore [Career Pathways](/career-pathways/) -- many do not require science degrees
3. Check [Resources](/resources/) -- start with podcasts and YouTube channels

You do not need to become a scientist to work in biotech.

---

## "What is the job market like?"

Biotech is growing rapidly. According to industry reports:
- Strong demand for manufacturing roles
- High need for data scientists and engineers
- Growing regulatory and quality assurance positions
- Increasing focus on computational biology

Entry-level salaries typically range from $50k-$80k depending on role and location.

---

## "Do I need to live in a biotech hub?"

It helps, but it is not required. Major hubs include:
- Boston/Cambridge
- San Francisco Bay Area
- San Diego
- Research Triangle (NC)
- Seattle

Biotech companies exist in many cities, and remote work is increasingly common for non-lab roles.

---

## "How do I get my first internship or job?"

**For students:**
- Apply to summer research programs (REUs, company internships)
- Reach out to professors about lab positions
- Attend career fairs
- Join biotech student organizations

**For career changers:**
- Highlight transferable skills on your resume
- Network on LinkedIn (join biotech groups)
- Consider contract positions to get your foot in the door
- Take online courses to show interest (many are free)

---

## "What skills should I learn?"

Depends on your path, but universally valuable:
- **Data analysis** (Excel, Python, R)
- **Project management** (organization, communication)
- **Regulatory knowledge** (FDA, GMP basics)
- **Scientific literacy** (ability to read papers, understand concepts)

See [Resources](/resources/) for where to learn these.

## "I have more questions. How can I get help?"

[Get in touch](/get-involved/) -- we are building a mentorship program and are happy to point you in the right direction.

You can also email us directly at [contact@biobridge.org](mailto:contact@biobridge.org).
