  <h1>What is Biotechnology, Really?</h1>
  <p>Understanding the science that's shaping our future — in plain language.</p>
</div>

Biotechnology is using living systems—cells, bacteria, proteins, DNA—to create useful products or solve problems.

If that sounds vague, it's because biotech is **incredibly broad**. It touches medicine, agriculture, environmental science, manufacturing, and more.

## Real-World Examples

Instead of abstract definitions, let's look at some examples of how biotech is applied in real life.

<div class="bb-example-grid">

  <div class="bb-example-card">
    <h3>Medicine</h3>
    <p><strong>Did you know</strong> the insulin keeping millions of diabetics alive is made by bacteria? Scientists insert the human insulin gene into E. coli to create tiny living factories churning out life-saving medicine.</p>
    <p>You might know <strong>CAR-T therapy</strong>, the treatment for cancer. Doctors extract your immune cells, genetically reprogram them to recognize cancer, and inject them back into you. Your own cells become trained assassins against tumors.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bb-example-card">
    <h3>Agriculture</h3>
    <p><strong>Drought-resistant crops</strong> can survive on 30% less water. In regions facing water scarcity, this isn't innovation—it's survival.</p>
    <p><strong>The "bleeding" in plant-based burgers?</strong> That's heme, a protein made by engineered yeast. It's what makes Impossible meat taste weirdly, disturbingly similar to beef.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bb-example-card">
    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <p><strong>Bacteria that eat oil spills.</strong> Yes, really. Bioremediation uses microbes that break down petroleum into harmless compounds, turning environmental disasters into manageable cleanups.</p>
    <p><strong>Bioplastics decompose in months, not centuries.</strong> Made from plants instead of petroleum, they could replace traditional plastics in packaging, utensils, and more.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bb-example-card">
    <h3>Cutting Edge</h3>
    <p><strong>Bioprinting organs is happening.</strong> Researchers use 3D printers loaded with living cells to build skin grafts, cartilage, and blood vessels.</p>
    <p><strong>Brain organoids</strong>—mini-brains grown from stem cells in a lab—are helping scientists study Alzheimer's, test new drugs, and understand brain development without human trials.</p>
  </div>

## Beyond the Science

<div class="bb-section-text" markdown="1">

A breakthrough in the lab is just the beginning. Getting it from concept to the real world takes an entire team of people who aren't scientists.

Take mRNA vaccines. The science behind them existed for decades, but turning that research into something that reached billions of people took work beyond the lab.

You need business strategists to decide what's worth pursuing and who's going to pay for it. You need regulatory experts to design safe trials and navigate the FDA. You need engineers to figure out how to manufacture at scale without losing quality.

Someone has to ask the hard questions: Should we edit human genes? Who gets access? What could go wrong? That's policy and ethics. You also have the communicators who need to explain a new technology to a skeptical public.

Every major biotech breakthrough follows this pattern. Science is step one and everything else is steps two through twenty. That's why biotech needs business strategists, engineers, lawyers, writers, ethicists, and project managers just as much as it needs scientists.

## Common Misconceptions

<div class="bb-misconception">
  <strong>"You need to be good at biology to be in the industry."</strong>
  <p>Not necessarily. If you can explain complex ideas simply, you could do science communication. If you're good with numbers and logistics, there's operations. Biotech hosts a range of humanities majors, business students, and engineers just as much as biology PhDs.</p>
</div>

<div class="bb-misconception">
  <strong>"It's all lab work."</strong>
  <p>Lab work is one part. There's also manufacturing, regulatory affairs, sales, policy, data analysis, and more! Check out <a href="/career-pathways/" style="color: #d97706; font-weight: 600;">Career Pathways</a> for additional information.</p>
</div>

<div class="bb-misconception">
  <strong>"You need a PhD."</strong>
  <p>Only if you want to lead research. Most biotech jobs in regulatory, manufacturing, business, and operations require a bachelor's degree or less. Some roles just need a high school diploma and training. Certificate programs take months, not years. There are entry points at every level, and you can build a six-figure career without ever going back to school.</p>
