# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions from people just starting to explore biotechnology.

---

## "I'm in high school. Where do I start?"

Start with [What is Biotech?](/biobridge/what-is-biotech/) to understand what the field actually is. Then browse the [Career Pathways](/biobridge/career-pathways/) to see what roles exist.

**Action steps:**
- Read biotech news (check our [Resource Hub](/biobridge/resources/))
- Take AP Biology or chemistry if available
- Look for summer programs or science competitions
- Follow biotech companies on social media to see what they do

You have plenty of time to explore!

---

## "I'm in college but not majoring in biology. Can I still get into biotech?"

**Absolutely.** Biotech needs:
- Engineers (process, chemical, mechanical)
- Computer scientists (bioinformatics, data analysis)
- Business majors (operations, sales, strategy)
- Communications majors (science writing, marketing)

Check out [Career Pathways](/biobridge/career-pathways/) to see non-research roles.

---

## "I'm changing careers. Is it too late?"

Not at all. Many people enter biotech in their 30s, 40s, or later.

**Common paths for career changers:**
- Project management (if you have PM experience)
- Regulatory affairs (especially if you have legal/compliance background)
- Sales and business development
- Manufacturing and operations
- Science communication

Some roles value your previous experience MORE than a biotech background.

---

## "I don't have a science background. Can I still learn?"

Yes! Our entire site is designed for beginners.

**Start here:**
1. Read [What is Biotech?](/biobridge/what-is-biotech/) - no prerequisites needed
2. Explore [Career Pathways](/biobridge/career-pathways/) - many don't require science degrees
3. Check [Resources](/biobridge/resources/) - start with podcasts and YouTube channels

You don't need to become a scientist to work in biotech.

---

## "What's the job market like?"

Biotech is growing rapidly. According to industry reports:
- Strong demand for manufacturing roles
- High need for data scientists and engineers
- Growing regulatory and quality assurance positions
- Increasing focus on computational biology

Entry-level salaries typically range from $50k-$80k depending on role and location.

---

## "Do I need to live in a biotech hub?"

It helps, but it's not required. Major hubs include:
- Boston/Cambridge
- San Francisco Bay Area
- San Diego
- Research Triangle (NC)
- Seattle

But biotech companies exist in many cities, and remote work is increasingly common for non-lab roles.

---

## "How do I get my first internship/job?"

**For students:**
- Apply to summer research programs (REUs, company internships)
- Reach out to professors about lab positions
- Attend career fairs
- Join biotech student organizations

**For career changers:**
- Highlight transferable skills on your resume
- Network on LinkedIn (join biotech groups)
- Consider contract positions to get your foot in the door
- Take online courses to show interest (many are free)

---

## "What skills should I learn?"

Depends on your path, but universally valuable:
- **Data analysis** (Excel, Python, R)
- **Project management** (organization, communication)
- **Regulatory knowledge** (FDA, GMP basics)
- **Scientific literacy** (ability to read papers, understand concepts)

See [Resources](/biobridge/resources/) for where to learn these.
