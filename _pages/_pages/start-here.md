# Welcome to BioBridge

If you're reading this, you're curious about biotechnology but might not know where to begin. That's exactly why BioBridge exists.

## What You'll Find Here

BioBridge is not a course. It's not a bootcamp. It's a **starting point** — a place to demystify biotech, explore career paths, and find your first step forward.

### Three Simple Paths:

1. **"I don't even know what biotech is"** → Start with [What is Biotech?](/what-is-biotech/)
2. **"I'm interested but don't know what I could do"** → Explore [Career Pathways](/career-pathways/)
3. **"I want to learn more on my own"** → Browse the [Resource Hub](/resources/)

## The BioBridge Philosophy

- **Access over expertise** — You don't need a PhD to start learning
- **Confidence over credentials** — We help you take the first step
- **Multiple pathways** — There's no "one right way" into biotech
- **Plain language** — No jargon unless we explain it first
