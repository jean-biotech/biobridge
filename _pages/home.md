# Making Biotechnology Accessible to Everyone

BioBridge exists because biotech often feels overly technical, credential-gated, and unwelcoming to nontraditional or late entrants. We lower the barrier to entry through plain-language education, mentorship, and clear pathways.

## Who This Is For

BioBridge is designed for students who are curious about biotechnology but don't know where to begin. Whether you're in high school, college, or considering a career change, we provide the access, exposure, and credibility you need to make biotech feel possible.

**You don't need a science background. You just need curiosity.**

## The BioBridge Difference

- **Access over expertise** - You don't need a PhD to start learning
- **Confidence over credentials** - We help you take the first step  
- **Multiple pathways** - There's no "one right way" into biotech
- **Plain language** - No jargon unless we explain it first
