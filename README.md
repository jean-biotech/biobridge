# BioBridge

A student-led biotech access initiative helping students who are curious about biotechnology but don't know where to begin.

## About

BioBridge exists because biotech often feels overly technical, credential-gated, and unwelcoming to nontraditional or late entrants. We lower the barrier to entry through plain-language education, mentorship, and clear pathways.
