    <h2 style="color: #7a9b76;">What is BioBridge?</h2>
    <p>BioBridge is a student-led platform designed to make biotech more understandable and accessible through clear explanations, curated resources, and honest guidance. If you're curious but unsure where to begin, you're in the right place.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #7a9b76;">The Problem</h2>
    <p>Biotechnology plays a growing role in how we treat disease, produce food, and respond to global challenges, but learning about it can feel overwhelming at first. Many students are interested in biotech but don't know what it actually is, what jobs exist, or whether they belong in the field.</p>

      <p>I was certain I'd become a doctor. In college, I even completed the shadowing hours, prerequisites, and extracurriculars. But the closer I pushed myself to a future in clinical work, the more I questioned whether it was actually right for me and I realized I needed a different direction.</p>
      
      <p>While anxiously searching for alternatives, I discovered my school offered a combined BS/MS in biotechnology that I could complete in four years. I knew almost nothing about biotech when I applied, but the program revealed just how expansive the field actually is—not just lab work, but business strategy, regulatory policy, manufacturing operations, and more.</p>
      
      <p>I started documenting what I was learning on social media, and the audience grew fast. Tens of thousands of people, and my DMs turned into a constant stream of the same questions: What is biotech? How do I break in? Do I need a PhD? People were curious, but lacked a practical starting point. So, I built BioBridge as the resource I wish had existed when I was trying to figure it out.</p>
