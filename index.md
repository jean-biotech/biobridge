# Making Biotechnology Accessible to Everyone

BioBridge exists because biotech often feels overly technical, credential-gated, and unwelcoming to nontraditional or late entrants. We lower the barrier to entry through plain-language education, mentorship, and clear pathways.

---

## Who This Is For

BioBridge is designed for students who are curious about biotechnology but don't know where to begin. Whether you're in high school, college, or considering a career change, we provide the access, exposure, and credibility you need to make biotech feel possible.

**You don't need a science background. You just need curiosity.**
